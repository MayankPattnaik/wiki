## Supernovae

A supernova is a huge explosion that happens during the death of a star. As a star nears its death its core starts to collapse. This collapse is so strong that protons and electrons inside the star combine to form neutrons. The outer layer is then thrown off in a massive explosion.

Supernovae release huge amounts of energy. The amount of energy released can go up to $$10^{51}$$ ergs.

> A single supernova can release more energy in a few weeks than the Sun will emit over its entire 10-billion-year lifetime.

Supernovae are the sole reason for heavy elements in our universe. It provides the right conditions for the nucleosynthesis of these elements.

### Types of Supernova

1. Type I Supernova:
   When a dwarf star in its [binary system](../special%20stars/binary%20stars.html) accretes material from its companion star it can increase its mass beyond the Chandrasekhar limit.After exceeding the limit the star becomes unstable and it triggers a thermonuclear explosion resulting in a supernova.

2. Type II Supernova:
   When a massive star(Mass more than 8 solar masses) collapses under its gravity to explode. This explosion is the result of a sudden shockwave formed by the rebound of the collapsing outer layers of the star after they collide with the newly formed dense core.
